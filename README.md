# 🎯 Truth or Dare — On-Chain Challenge Game

## 🧩 Project Description

**Truth or Dare (On-Chain)** is a simple, beginner-friendly **Solidity smart contract** that turns the classic “Truth or Dare” party game into a decentralized experience.
Players can create and complete challenges directly on the blockchain, with real ETH rewards at stake.

It’s designed as an easy-to-understand learning project for newcomers exploring blockchain, smart contracts, and on-chain logic.

## ⚙️ What It Does

* Players **submit** a challenge (either a “Truth” or a “Dare”) by sending a small ETH reward.
* Other users can **complete** the challenge to claim the reward.
* All actions are **recorded on-chain**, ensuring transparency and fairness.

---

## ✨ Features

* 🧠 **Simple to Use** — Just two main functions: `submitChallenge()` and `completeChallenge()`.
* 💰 **ETH Rewards** — Each challenge comes with a real on-chain incentive.
* 🔒 **Fully Transparent** — Every submission and completion is verifiable on the blockchain.
* 🌐 **Deployed on Celo Sepolia Testnet** — Try it live using your MetaMask wallet.
* 🧑‍💻 **Beginner Friendly** — Perfect starting point for learning Solidity smart contract basics.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org)
* MetaMask wallet connected to **Celo Sepolia Testnet**
* Some testnet ETH from a Celo faucet

### Steps to Run

1. Open Remix and paste the code above.
2. Compile with Solidity version **^0.8.30**.
3. Deploy using the **Injected Provider (MetaMask)** environment.
4. Interact with the contract:

   * Call `submitChallenge()` to post a new Truth or Dare.
   * Call `completeChallenge()` to finish one and earn the reward.

---

## 💡 Future Ideas

* Add **verification or voting** to confirm challenge completion.
* Introduce **NFT rewards** for completed challenges.
* Build a **React front-end** for smoother gameplay.
